# PerfCheck CI Requirements

Perf Check CI is a web application to manage jobs that measure and compare performance on another web application.

## Creating a job

* As a user I want to create a job to compare the performance of two branches across multiple request paths.

## Measurements and statistics

* As a developer I want to store all measurements from a PerfCheck run so can process them later.
* As a developer I want to compute summary statistics over measurements so I can use them for reporting.

## Reporting

* As a user I want to know if the performance measured in the job is better, about the same, or worse than the reference measurement.
